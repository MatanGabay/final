Super passionate about food and restaurants I usually suffer from the diffuculty of finding agood and accurate recommendation for a restaurant
This pain point often comes from different biases in websites like Trip Advisor where the reviews are from people that are very different than me
My idea was to create an MVP for a website where you see the recommendations of restaurants from the people you chose to follow (e.g., your social media friends and people you decide to follow)

The idea is to create the "go to" website to find a restaurant in a very quick and easy way with a simple interface and recommendations from the people you trust

The MVP website is also hosted on Heroku on:
